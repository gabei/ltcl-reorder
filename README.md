<h1>LTCL Reorder and Monorepo</h1>
<p>The reorder tool allows users to upload a receipt in CSV format and get back a document in the desired order + additional columns. It is very basic and designed only for specific formats.</p>

<p>This repo is originally intended to give staff access to various scripts and tools that I make over time. I wanted a place to continuously deploy them and act as a jumping off point. In reality, many of these tools could be done with shell scripts or maybe within the various Microsoft suite applications themselves. I consider this a learning / "passion" project.</p>
